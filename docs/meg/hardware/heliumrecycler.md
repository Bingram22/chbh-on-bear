# Helium Recycler System

The technology that helps record the minute magnetic fields is a superconducting quantum interference detector (SQUID) which is like a highly sensitive magnetic field meter. To maintain superconductors one needs to provide an extremely cold environment, which is achieved by using liquid helium around the sensors.

At the CHBH we use an integrated closed-loop helium reliquefaction system which collects the helium gas that boils off during testing. The boiling helium gas is directed via the helium gas line to the helium recycler cabinet for compression, and from there for storage in pressurized helium gas storage tanks. Reliquefying the collected helium is only possible when the MEG is not in use.
