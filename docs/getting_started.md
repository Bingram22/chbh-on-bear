# Getting started on BEAR

This page collects tutorials and examples for neuroimaging analyses to run on BlueBEAR. This is intended to extend the main [Bear Technical Documentation](https://docs.bear.bham.ac.uk/) pages.

Here we provide a set of links, tips and tricks for getting started. Mostly linking out to other places.

## Step 0: Linux

Bear provide a [Introduction to Linux](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/arc/bear/training/intro-linux) guide. Many computing services on bear rely on linux. There are in-person workshops and an online canvas courses available on this page.

## Step 1: BlueBEAR

Bear also provide a [Introduction to BlueBEAR](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/it/teams/infrastructure/research/bear/bear-training/necessities.aspx) course. There are in person workshops and an online canvas course.

## Step 2: RDS Projects

You'll need to be a member of a Bear project and have a Bear linux account to use BlueBEAR. Your PI and lab can help with this. A detailed guide for [accessing BEAR](https://docs.bear.bham.ac.uk/bluebear/accessing/) is provided on the technical docs.

## Step 3: Bear Portal

[BEAR Portal](https://docs.bear.bham.ac.uk/portal/accessing/)  provides web-based access to a range of BEAR services, such as JupyterLab, RStudio, and various other GUI applications. BEAR Portal is only available on campus or using the University Remote Access Service.

## Step 4: Launching interactive sessions

From BEAR Portal there are three options for launching an interactive analysis session.

- Some software packages have [GUI Apps](https://docs.bear.bham.ac.uk/portal/gui_apps/)  installed on BlueBEAR that can be launched from the Bear Portal - the main example for neuroimaging analysis is Matlab.

- [JupyterLab](https://docs.bear.bham.ac.uk/portal/jupyterlab/) and [RStudio](https://docs.bear.bham.ac.uk/portal/rstudio/) are installed as standalone apps that can be launched from BEAR Portal. (ote that only packages installed on Bear Apps are available to load in JupyterLab).

- A complete Linux Desktop can be launched as the [BlueBEAR GUI](https://docs.bear.bham.ac.uk/portal/gui/). BlueBEAR GUI is effectively a blank-slate linux desktop, into which you can load the modules for various applications, specify environment variables etc. by using the built-in Terminal client (see image below), and then ultimately launch the interface for the application that you require.

## Step 5: Running cluster jobs with Slurm

There are two ways to submit a cluster job - the [bluebear terminal](https://docs.bear.bham.ac.uk/bluebear/jobs/) and the [job submission page on Bear Portal](https://docs.bear.bham.ac.uk/portal/jobs/)

**BlueBEAR Terminal** Once you have prepared a submission script, you can go to that location in the BEAR-Portal file browser and click 'Open in termnal' in the top. This will open a terminal session from which you can submit, monitor and (optionally) cancel your job using `sbatch`, `squeue` and `scontrol`.

!!! note
    These terminal sessions are ONLY intended for submitting and monitoring cluster jobs - not for active analyses. This should be carried out on BEAR GUI or similiar.

**BlueBEAR Job Composer** this is a GUI page which helps you to write a new job to submit to blue-bear using the [job composer](https://docs.bear.bham.ac.uk/portal/jobs/#creating-a-new-compute-job-through-the-bear-portal).
